chemiclj is a chemistry library for clojure

NOTE: make sure that the dependencies are installed be lein deps, or by
putting the appropriate symlinks in a directory named checkouts.

Dependencies

 shortuct - a graph library for clojure

currently, chemiclj only requires shortcut (and clojure and
clojure-contrib) but as there is (not yet) an official release of a
shortcut jar on clojars, or elsewhere, one MUST INSTALL SHORTCUT BY
HAND IN PLACE A SYMLINK TO IT IN THE checkouts DIRECTORY. This
requires leiningen 1.2 or later.
