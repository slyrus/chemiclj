1. SMILES Parsing

 - deal with dot -- ???

 - support wildcards

 - error checking for double bond configurations

 - support configurations for bonds at opening and closing of rings

 - support %xx two-digit ring symbols

 HALF-DONE throw an error if there is a conflict with bond orders specified
   at ring opening and closing -- this is done, but probably done incorrectly

 DONE cycles -- parsing is ok, but need to connect up the other bond!

 DONE bond arity -- again, parsing works, but we don't set the bond
      arity

 DONE fix names of aromatic bracket atoms!!!

 DONE fix bond order of ring bonds

 DONE fix bond order specified at ring closing and 

 DONE bugfix: c1cCccc1 breaks aromatic bond fixup

 DONE BUGFIX: bracket aromatic atoms aren't treated as such

 DONE add implicit hydrogens (and explicit via [H] exprs!)

 DONE post-processing phase to fix arity of bonds:

   DONE between aromatic atoms

   DONE fill in unspecified bond arities (default to single unless
        between two aromatic atoms)

 DONE support tetrahedral configurations

 DONE deal with explicit H in tetrahedral configuration atoms (@ and @@)

 DONE bugfix: inappropriate double bond inferrence between two aromatic nitrogens
   where one has three neighbors already (see sildenafil N2=N1).

 DONE BUGFIX: default charge for bracket atoms is nil instead of 0

 DONE handle chiral configurations in cycles, e.g. "C[C@H]1CCCCO1"

 DONE double bond configuration (E/Z, up/down)

 DONE BUGFIX: chiral ring bonds don't get recorded in the configuration properly

2. SMILES Writing

 - @ and @@

 - bracket atoms

 - uggh... writing up/down double-bond configurations

 - write disconnected molecules ([Na+].[Cl-] being the simple example)
