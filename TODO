1. SMILES Parsing

 - deal with dot -- ???

 - support wildcards

 HALF-DONE throw an error if there is a conflict with bond orders specified
   at ring opening and closing -- this is done, but probably done incorrectly

 DONE cycles -- parsing is ok, but need to connect up the other bond!

 DONE bond arity -- again, parsing works, but we don't set the bond arity

 DONE fix names of aromatic bracket atoms!!!

 DONE fix bond order of ring bonds

 DONE fix bond order specified at ring closing and 

 DONE bugfix: c1cCccc1 breaks aromatic bond fixup

 DONE BUGFIX: bracket aromatic atoms aren't treated as such

 DONE add implicit hydrogens (and explicit via [H] exprs!)

 DONE- post-processing phase to fix arity of bonds:

   DONE between aromatic atoms

   DONE fill in unspecified bond arities (default to single unless
      between two aromatic atoms)
